# weather_station
This project is derived from, but significantly enhanmced from a weather station described here:

This is to be used with a Raspberry Pi. As far as I know it won't run anywhere else since it needs the proper GPIO socket.

I made changes to allow for a 2.7in (254x176) or a 7.5in (800x480) Waveshare e-ink display.

I also set up a process to download icons if needed.
